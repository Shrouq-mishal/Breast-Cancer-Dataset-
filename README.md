# Breast Cancer Dataset Project ðŸ”¬ðŸ“Š
## Overview
This project aims to investigate and compare the performance of three different machine learning classification models: Polynomial Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on the Breast Cancer Dataset. The Breast Cancer Dataset is a well-known dataset containing various features computed from digitized images of breast cancer masses, and it is commonly used for classification tasks.
